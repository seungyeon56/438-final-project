Project overview and purpose
This project is a personal study & work playlist which uses the YouTube Data API to fetch songs and save them on
the Firebase. I chose this project topic because I listen to music very often while studying
or taking a break, and I use YouTube Music app daily, which naturally led me to use YouTube API
for this project.

Here is the link to my demo video:

Technologies used
I used Webstorm for the codes and Firebase for saving and loading the videos from the YouTube. 

Setup and installation instructions
As soon as I opened new project file, I installed "react-router-dom" using the terminal. 
Then, I worked on setting up an overall structure (e.g. components and pages) based on my initial
low-fidelity wireframes. When I started working on the authentication part of this web app, 
I installed Firebase to save user information and added songs from the YouTube. 

Usage guidelines
After making a new Vite project with react template, I entered "npm install react-router-dom" 
on the terminal to import react. Whenever I wanted to check whether the codes are working, 
I entered "npm run dev", which would give me a link to web app, allowing me to check that it's
functioning fine. I often right-clicked the web app page to inspect and check errors. 

Future enhancements or known issues
There are so many future improvements I can make to this web app. First, I can add "favorite" icon
next to each song that shows the number of times it was played. This would let 
users know which song they listened the most, allowing for wider personalization. 
Secondly, I can improve the overall CSS, especially the home page since now it looks very minimal. 
Lastly, I can also implement "profile" page, where it would show user email, profile photo, 
and search history loaded from the Firebase. 

AI use statement (even if no AI was used). 
List the prompts you used and the help you received.
I asked ChatGPT on how I can make YouTube videos playable on my web app. Initially, I thought 
I had to make separate play buttons to make videos playable (or have play buttons and video thumbnail
like typical playlist app). But, ChatGPT recommended iframe tag which would allow videos playable. 
I asked this question again during office hour to confirm and realized I did not need to make separate
play buttons. Thus, I decided not to make play buttons to minimize redundancy in my design.

Personal reflection on what you learned during the project 
Discussion of how the project helped you develop your web development skills
When I first started this project, I was very worried about where I should start first from the scratch.
At first, I thought I had to make each page fully functioning before proceeding to next page. But,
I received a feedback that it doesn't need to be fully functioning yet and instead just focus 
on the UI of each page first and then work on the authentication and API later. This feedback really
made me feel less overwhelmed. Working on the UI of each page was fun, since I was able to use
skills from previous assignments. However, the biggest challenge was the API part. 
When I started working on the API part, it was taking much longer than I expected to just create 
one working page. I realized I should revise my initial plan considering the given time. 
Connecting pages was also another challenge. While my final project seems simple, I dedicated a lot of 
time and efforts into each page to ensure it's functioning well. My goal for this project
definitely shifted over time. I initially started this project with a goal of making web app with
diverse features, but my goal changed to focusing more on functionality in the end since I had a
limited amount of time. I gained a lot of skills (such as using API and Firebase) throughout this 
project, and most importantly, I learned to be patient to produce the outcome I truly want.
